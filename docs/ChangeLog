	* notification-spec.xml:
	  - Changed the app_icon parameter of Notify to take a byte array,
	    string, or NIL, so that it's the same as loading a single frame
	    of a set of images.
	  - Renamed "Icons and Sounds" to just "Icons."
	  - Changed the wording about the fallback in case the notification
	    server can't do actions.
