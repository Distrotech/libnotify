version 0.4.1:
	* Added support for attaching to a GtkStatusIcon. Patch by chpe. (Bug #60)
	* Added GObject properties to NotifyNotification. Patch by chpe. (Bug #60)
	* Fixed up libnotify.pc to support dependencies correctly. (Bug #58)
	* Fixed notify_uninit() to properly set _initted to FALSE after being
	  called. (Bug #56)

version 0.4.0 (26-April-2006):
	* Patch by M.S. to switch notify-send to use GOption instead of popt,
	  to add -v, --version, -h, and --hint options, and to rename
	  -T, --type to -c, --category. This also fixes assertions when calling
	  notify-send "". (Bug #41)
	* Fixed the short flag for --type to be -T in notify-send. (Bug #18)
	* Fixed the help in notify-send to indicate that --expire-timeout
	  requires milliseconds, not seconds. (Bug #28)
	* Fixed some C99 usage. Patch by jensgr. (Bug #44)
	* Fixed notify-send on PPC.

version 0.3.2 (23-January-2006):
	* Added back notify_get_server_info() and notify_get_server_caps().
	* Fixed to work with D-BUS 0.36 and higher. However, it's best to note
	  that due to bugs in versions of the D-BUS GLib bindings before 0.60,
	  raw image data cannot be sent in notifications. A warning will be
	  outputted to the console.
	* Added assertions to all of the API functions so that invalid data passed
	  won't crash the calling program.
	* Added automatic notification removal for non-expiring notifications and
	  notifications with actions when the calling application closes.
	* Fixed issues where the header files couldn't always be included in
	  some programs.
	* Fixed a lot of compiler errors and warnings.
	* Fixed C99 usage.
	* Added the ability to set user data on action callbacks on a per-action
	  basis.
	* Fixed notify-send to work without crashing.
	* Fixed the library to send messages appropriate to the D-BUS
	  specification.
	* Cleaned up the API a lot.
	* Renamed NOTIFY_TIMEOUT_* to NOTIFY_EXPIRES_*.
	* Removed notify_notification_show_and_forget().
	* Internal changes to remove the number of DBusGProxy connections, and
	  make sure it's initialized before using any D-BUS GValue-related code.
	  This fixes raw image sending.
